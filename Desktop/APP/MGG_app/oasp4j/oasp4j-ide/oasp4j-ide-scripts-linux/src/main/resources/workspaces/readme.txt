In this directory you create your workspaces (typically one for each branch). There is always one
MAIN_BRANCH (see variables) called main. You can add any new workspace by creating and empty folder here. 
Once you called "update-all-workspaces" the workspaces are initialized/updated and an according 
eclipse-<workspace> start script is created. You can checkout the according branch to that workspace 
folder and import the projects into the corresponding eclipse instance. The workspace name is also 
visible in the title-bar of Eclipse so you get orientation when you have multiple instances of 
eclipse running simultaneously.
