= Transaction Handling

Transactions are technically processed by the link:guide-dataaccess-layer[data access layer]. However, the transaction control has to be performed in upper layers. To avoid dependencies on persistence layer and technical code in upper layers, we use link:guide-aop[AOP] to add transaction control via annotations as aspect.

As we recommend using http://spring.io[spring], we use the +@Transactional+ annotation (for a JEE application server you would use +@TransactionAttribute+ instead). We use this annotation in the link:guide-logic-layer[logic layer] to annotate business methods that participate in transactions (what typically applies to all business components).

[source,java]
@Transactional
public class MyExampleLogicImpl {
  public MyDataTo getData(MyCriteriaTo criteria) {
    ...
  }
  ...
}

== Batches
Transaction control for batches is a lot more complicated and is described in the link:guide-batch-layer[batch layer].
