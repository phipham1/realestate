= Get Started

== Start from scratch

The easiest way to get started is the oasp4j-app-template. It is a maven archetype, generating the most important code and configurations needed by an application using the oasp4j.
To use the archetype follow these steps:

. Clone oasp4j-sample*
. Go to the oasp4j-app-template directory*
. Install the archetype +mvn install+*
. See the link:http://books.sonatype.com/m2eclipse-book/reference/creating.html#creating-sect-m2e-create-archetype[m2e documentation] on how to generate the application within eclipse.
** Use group ID +io.oasp.java+ and artifact ID +oasp4j-app-template+

NOTE: *Steps 1 to 3 can be omitted once the oasp4j-app-template is published to a public repository.
