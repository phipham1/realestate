= Client Layer

There are various technical approaches to build GUI clients. The OASP proposes rich clients that connect to the server via data-oriented link:guide-service-layer[services] (e.g. using REST with JSON).
In general we have to distinguish the following types of clients:

* web clients
* native desktop clients
* (native) mobile clients

Currently we focus on web-clients. So far we offer a responsive Java Script based client provided by OASP4js that integrates seamless with OASP-server. A separate guide is provided for https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js[OASP4JS].
